**Hi, I’m Paden Hall - an aerospace engineer with a passion for design, analysis, and hands-on innovation. My path in engineering has been defined by a balance of technical precision and leadership, from optimizing manufacturing systems to leading aerodynamic testing in the lab. I’m driven by a simple principle: turn data into action, and ideas into impact.**
