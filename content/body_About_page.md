**Hi, I’m Paden Hall - an aerospace engineer with a passion for design, analysis, and hands-on innovation. My path in engineering has been defined by a balance of technical precision and leadership, from optimizing manufacturing systems to leading aerodynamic testing in the lab. I’m driven by a simple principle: turn data into action, and ideas into impact.
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, where I gained extensive experience across aerodynamic testing, structural analysis, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and manufacturing process development. My approach combines theory with application - using engineering tools like ANSYS Fluent, NASTRAN/FEMAP, MATLAB, and SolidWorks to connect digital simulations with real-world results.**

**During my time at Lucix Corporation as a Manufacturing Engineer Intern, I led projects that directly improved efficiency and reduced waste in production. I spearheaded the installation of a scribe marking machine that reduced cycle time by 56%, eliminating a key bottleneck in the assembly line. I also developed an Excel-VBA and Power Query automation tool that tracked cycle times across 40+ part numbers, cutting total manufacturing time by 10% and enabling the team to make data-driven decisions in real time. I take pride in projects like these — where process optimization directly strengthens performance and product reliability.**

**Before my engineering internships, I gained two years of operational leadership experience at Amazon Air, managing over 80 aviation personnel to ensure on-time aircraft turnarounds and regulatory compliance. This experience shaped my ability to lead under pressure, communicate clearly, and keep operations running safely and efficiently — skills that continue to influence my engineering approach today. I’ve found that managing people and managing systems have a lot in common: both require consistency, clarity, and accountability to achieve results.**

**At Cal Poly Pomona, I served as Project Deputy and Wind Tunnel Operations Lead for the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) research team, where I trained and led 10+ students in advanced fluid dynamics testing. This project deepened my understanding of aerodynamic behavior and gave me experience integrating experimental data with CFD modeling to improve predictive accuracy. I also led the CFD team for a Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft, running over 30 simulations in ANSYS Fluent and NASTRAN/FEMAP to optimize aerodynamic performance and validate models with wind tunnel data.**

**These projects taught me how to combine analytical problem-solving with collaboration. Whether designing an experimental setup, interpreting flow data, or refining CAD geometry, I’ve learned that great engineering doesn’t just solve a problem — it tells a story of improvement, precision, and innovation.**

**Outside of engineering, I’m an avid hiker, motorcycle rider, and student pilot. I’ve climbed Mt. Whitney, the tallest peak in the contiguous United States, and logged over 40 flight hours while pursuing my private pilot’s license. These experiences have shaped my mindset: stay composed under pressure, plan every step carefully, and always respect the environment you’re working in — whether it’s a mountain trail, a flight deck, or a test lab.**

**I’m passionate about the intersection of aerodynamics, propulsion, and systems design, and I aim to contribute to the next generation of aerospace innovation — from more efficient airframes to advanced manufacturing processes. My goal is to continue building a career that blends technical engineering, leadership, and hands-on problem solving, always with an eye toward efficiency and reliability.**

**I believe that being an engineer isn’t just about equations and simulations — it’s about the drive to improve, adapt, and bring ideas to life. Every challenge is an opportunity to make something work a little better, a little faster, and a little smarter than it did before.**
